# Large Language Models (LLMs) in the Proposed System

## 1. Introduction
This section explores the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the proposed system and their potential use in generating explanations and recommendations for plant care.

## 2. Use of LLMs in Prior Research
Overview of how LLMs have been used in:
- Decision support systems
- Recommendation systems
- Knowledge-based applications

## 3. Risks and Challenges of LLMs
- Hallucinations
- Overconfidence in generated responses
- Lack of grounding in factual data
- Privacy and data concerns

## 4. Mitigation Strategies from Literature
- Grounding responses using external data
- Rule-based constraints
- Output validation
- Handling uncertainty

## 5. Proposed Role of LLMs in This Project
- Generating natural-language explanations
- Supporting user understanding
- Avoiding use as a primary data source

## 6. Barriers and Integration Risks
- Reliability concerns
- Evaluation challenges
- Dependency on external models

## 7. Summary
Summary of why LLMs are used in a limited and controlled manner in this project.
