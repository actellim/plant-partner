## Project Organization.

### External Interfaces. 
All work on this project will be completed by the four member student team. The project will interact with several external components.

The main external interfaces are:

- Hardware sensors used to collect plant data, including soil moisture, temperature and humidity sensors  
- A Raspberry Pi used to read and process sensor data  
- A user facing application or dashboard that displays recommendations  
- Optional external plant databases or APIs used to obtain species information  

The system will communicate with these components to collect data, process it, and present recommendations to the user. Regular communication with the course instructor will also be maintained to report progress and receive feedback.


### Internal Structure. 
The development team consists of four software engineering students working together on different aspects of the project.

The internal structure of the project is divided into the following main areas:

- Hardware and sensor integration  
- Backend software and recommendation logic  
- Frontend user interface  
- Documentation and project coordination  

The project follows the Unified Process model, which organizes the work into requirements, analysis, design, implementation and maintenance phases.


### Roles and Responsibilities.
Each team member has specific responsibilities to support the successful completion of the project. Because this course focuses on research, planning, and technical reporting rather than full software implementation, responsibilities are organized around project deliverables and teamwork activities.

The responsibilities are divided as follows:

- One team member will act as project leader for a portion of the semester, coordinating meetings, delegating tasks and ensuring that deadlines are met  
- One team member will focus on researching background information, literature, and existing technologies related to the project topic  
- One team member will focus on organizing and preparing written documentation, including reports, plans, and presentations  
- One team member will focus on developing design artifacts such as diagrams, system descriptions and technical analysis  

The role of project leader will rotate among team members as required by the course outline. This allows all members to practice leadership and planning skills.

All team members share responsibility for:

- Participating actively in research and analysis  
- Contributing to written reports and presentations  
- Attending meetings and seminars  
- Reviewing each other’s work  
- Meeting course deadlines  
- Maintaining a positive and cooperative attitude  
- Ensuring the overall quality of project deliverables  

The team will work collaboratively on all major submissions, and final documents will be reviewed and approved by the entire group before submission.


## Supporting Process Plan

### Configuration Management Plan. 
GitHub will be used as the main configuration management tool.

The following practices will be followed:

- All source code and documents will be stored in a shared GitHub repository  
- Team members will work on separate branches for new features  
- Pull requests will be used before merging changes  
- The main branch will always remain stable  
- Regular commits will be required from all members  

This approach ensures that all project artifacts are organized, traceable, and properly backed up.


### Testing Plan. 
Testing will be performed throughout the project to ensure reliability.

The testing process will include:

- Unit Testing: individual software components will be tested separately  
- Integration Testing: sensor hardware and software modules will be tested together  
- System Testing: the full system will be tested from data collection to recommendations  
- User Testing: team members will evaluate usability and clarity of outputs  

Test results will be documented and stored in the project repository.


### Documentation Plan. 
Clear documentation will be produced at every stage of the project.

The main documents include:

- Software Project Management Plan  
- Design and architecture documents  
- User guide and setup instructions  
- Test reports  
- Final project report  

All documentation will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure accuracy and consistency.


### Quality Assurance Plan and Reviews and Audits Plan. 
Quality will be ensured through:

- Regular peer reviews of code and documents  
- Weekly team meetings to track progress  
- Continuous testing and debugging  
- Instructor feedback and reviews  

No major component will be considered complete without review by at least one other team member.


### Problem Resolution Plan. 
If a problem occurs during the project:

- The issue will be discussed in team meetings  
- The responsible member will attempt to fix it  
- If needed, work will be reassigned  
- Serious problems will be reported to the project coordinator  

All important problems will be tracked using GitHub issues so they can be resolved in an organized way.


### Subcontractor Management Plan. 
This project does not involve any subcontractors.
All work will be completed by the student project team.


### Process Improvement Plan. 
The team will continuously improve its working process by:

- Reviewing progress after each milestone  
- Adjusting schedules when necessary  
- Improving communication methods  
- Learning from mistakes and feedback  

At the end of the project, a final review will be conducted to capture lessons learned.
