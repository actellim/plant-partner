# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## 1. Introduction
This section introduces Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and explains its relevance for providing reliable, knowledge-based recommendations.

## 2. RAG in Prior Research
Summary of how RAG has been applied

## 3. Data Sources for Retrieval
- Types of plant databases considered
- Information required (light, moisture, temperature, humidity)
- Licensing and citation considerations (I have checked with perenual license policy and we are good to use it in our research as long as it remains a non-commercial, personal, or educational endeavor.)

## 4. Proposed RAG Pipeline for This Project

### 4.1 Input
- Plant species
- Environmental sensor data

### 4.2 Retrieval Step
- How plant care information is retrieved
- Importance of grounding responses in retrieved content

### 4.3 Generation Step
- How the LLM uses retrieved information
- Explanation generation

## 5. Citation and Traceability Strategy
- How sources will be referenced
- Importance of explainability and transparency

## 6. Evaluation Strategy
- Correctness of retrieval
- Consistency with source data
- Handling missing or incomplete information

## 7. Barriers and Risks
- Incomplete datasets
- Retrieval errors
- Data quality issues

## 8. Summary
Summary of why RAG is essential for reliability in this project.
