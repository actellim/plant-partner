# Plant Health Monitoring Approach

## 1. Introduction
This section defines what “plant health monitoring” means in the context of the proposed project.

## 2. Definitions of Plant Health in Literature
- Environmental stress indicators
- Growth-related factors
- Risk-based health assessment

## 3. Approaches Reviewed

### 3.1 Sensor-Based Monitoring (can be edited based on what you researched)

- Common parameters used

### 3.2 Trend-Based Monitoring (can be edited based on what you researched)
- Monitoring changes over time
- Early warning indicators

### 3.3 AI/Data-Driven Monitoring (can be edited based on what you researched)
- Predictive approaches
- Limitations without real-world trials

## 4. Selected Approach for This Project
- Chosen health monitoring strategy
- Justification based on scope and feasibility

## 5. Risks and Limitations
- Lack of ground truth
- Simplified assumptions
- Environmental variability

## 6. Summary
Summary of how plant health monitoring contributes to the overall system.
