## Overview.

### Project Summary.

#### Purpose, Scope, and Objectives. 
The objective of this project is to develop a recommender/explainer application that uses sensors and AI to help users grow healthy plants by providing species-specific care recommendations. The app will use the sensor data (soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, nutrient levels, pH) with plant databases and potentially AI to give actionable, context-aware advice rather than generic thresholds. 

#### Assumptions and Constraints. 
- The scope is limited to indoor plants or a specific region (e.g., Canadian plants) depending on data availability.
- Water quality factors (chlorine, hard water) are considered out of scope for the core system.
- AI is limited to using retrieval-augmented generation to avoid hallucinations.
- The user interface must be simple enough for non-expert gardeners.

#### Project Deliverables. 
- A working recommender/explainer app integrating sensors and AI for plant care guidance.
- Documentation (literature review, annotated bibliography, etc.).

#### Schedule and Budget Summary. 
The duration and personnel requirements of each workflow are as follows:

- Requirements workflow (1 week, four team members)
- Analysis workflow (2 weeks, four team members)
- Design workflow (2 weeks, four team members)
- Implementation workflow (3 weeks, four team members)
- Testing workflow (2 weeks, four team members)
- The total development time is 10 weeks.

### Evolution of the Project Management Plan. 
All changes to this project management plan must be agreed upon by the entire project team and the group leader at the time before implementation. Changes should be documented to keep the plan accurate and up to date.

## Technical Process Plans.

### Process Model. 
The Unified Process will be used.

### Methods, Tools, and Techniques. 
- Workflows: All workflows will follow the Unified Process.
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi will be used for sensor integration; sensors may include soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, nutrient/EC and pH sensors.

### Infrastructure Plan. 
- Software/Languages: Python or similar for app development; AI integration using retrieval-augmented generation with plant databases to avoid hallucinations.
- APIs/Databases: External plant database APIs for species-specific information; manual user input for species identification if needed.

### Product Acceptance Plan. 
Acceptance of the product will be achieved by following the steps of the Unified Process, including phase deliverables such as use cases, class diagrams, working prototype, and testing.
